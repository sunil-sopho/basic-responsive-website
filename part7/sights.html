    <h2>See the Sights of San Francisco</h2>
    <p>The precipitous hills in San Francisco make it a city best  explored by public transport. Grab a <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm">Muni Passport</a>, and ride the buses,  streetcars, Metro, and—of course—the historic cable cars.</p>
    <figure class="floatright"><img src="images/cable_car2.jpg">
      <figcaption>The front seat of a cable car affords a great view of the city</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>One of the best ways to get familiar with the city is to  ride the Powell-Mason or Powell-Hyde cable car from Market Street. This takes  you through Union Square, up over Nob Hill, through Chinatown, down to the  waterfront at Fisherman’s Wharf. Stop off at Chinatown to soak in the unique  atmosphere of the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/">largest Chinatown outside Asia</a>. And if Chinese food sets your  mouth watering, there are nearly 200 authentic Chinese restaurants to choose  from.</p>
    <p>If you prefer seafood, then you’ll love <a href="http://www.fishermanswharf.org/">Fisherman’s Wharf</a>.  Even if you’re not hungry, just stroll around the waterfront looking at the  fishing boats and watching sea lions basking in the sun. Out in the Bay lies  Alcatraz (the Rock), once home to notorious criminals, including Al Capone.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>To visit Alcatraz, it’s advisable to <a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/index.aspx">book the ferry tickets  online</a> because they usually sell out about a week in advance. You’re left free  to wander around the Rock and the former federal prison. Budget about two and a  half hours for the trip, and be prepared for changeable weather.</p>
    <p>If you can't get tickets for Alcatraz, take one of the many  boat trips around San Francisco Bay. They take you around the Rock and out to  the Golden Gate Bridge, another iconic symbol of the city.</p>
    <p>Just a few ideas to get you started exploring this  fascinating city.</p>

    <h2>Tourist Information</h2>
    <p>There’s no shortage of information about what to see while  in San Francisco. The <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/">San Francisco Visitor Information Center</a> is the official  travel and visitors’ guide to the city, with information in 14 languages.</p>
    <p>Among the many unofficial sites, the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco">Lonely Planet guide to  San Francisco</a> is packed with useful information.</p>
    <h2>Sightseeing Tours</h2>
    <p>One way to see the city is on an <a href="http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/sanfrancisco/custompage.aspx">open-top bus</a>, a hop-on,  hop-off service that offers either prerecorded or live commentary. The route  goes over the Golden Gate Bridge, giving stunning views across the city (as  long as it’s not shrouded in fog!)</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling more energetic, several companies offer  bicycle rental. You can even cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge on the wide  bike path.</p>
    <p>And for something completely different… Why not <a href="http://www.electrictourcompany.com/">see the city  on a Segway</a>?</p>
